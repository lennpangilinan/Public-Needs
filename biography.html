                      <p><span class="font1">Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error</span> sit voluptatem The term of the members of the Senate is expressly provided in Articles VI and XVIII respectively of the Constitution:

Sec. 4. The term of office of the Senators shall be six years and shall commence, unless otherwise provided by law, at noon on the thirtieth day of June next following their election.

Sec. 2. The Senators, members of the House of Representatives, and the local officials first elected under this Constitution shall serve until noon of June 30, 1992.

Of the Senators elected in the election in 1992, the first twelve obtaining the highest number of votes shall serve for six years and the remaining twelve for three years.

It must be remembered that the 24 Senators first elected under the 1987 Constitution on May 2, 1987 served only for five years ending on June 30, 1992. Of the senators elected in 1992, the first 12 obtaining the highest number of votes served for the full term of six years expiring in 1998, and the last 12 served only three years and ended in 1995. After which, the 12 Senators elected in 1995 shall serve the full term of six years or until year 2001. Those 12 to be elected in 1998 shall also serve the full term of six years. In fine, beginning 1992, 12 Senators shall be elected every three years, so that unlike in the House of Representatives, the Senate shall not at anytime be completely dissolved. One-half of the membership is retained as the other half is replaced or reelected every three years.

The purpose of the continuity of the life of the Senate is intended to encourage the maintenance of Senate policies as well as guarantee that there will be experienced members who can help and train newcomers in the discharge of their duties. In addition, in case of resignation, death, permanent disability, removal from office, or resignation of the President and Vice-President, the Senate President shall act as President.

Moreover, the Constitution, in Section 4, Article VI, provides limits to the extent a member of the Senate can run for reelection. It provides as follows:

No Senator shall serve for more than two consecutive terms. Voluntary renunciation of the office for any length of time shall not be considered as an inter-ruption in the continuity of his service for the full term for which he was elected. <a href="https://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/terms.asp">Senate Court</a>Philippines </p>

                    <p><span class="font1">Preliminary Procedures</span>The procedures for introducing legislation and seeing it through committees are similar in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. 

Legislative proposals originate in a number of different ways. Members of the Senate, of course, develop ideas for legislation. Technical assistance in research and drafting legislative language is available at the Senate Legislative Technical Affairs Bureau. Special interest groups—business, religious, labor, urban and rural poor, consumers, trade association, and the like—are other fertile sources of legislation. Constituents, either as individuals or groups, also may propose legislation. Frequently, a member of the Senate will introduce such a bill by request, whether or not he supports its purposes.

It must be noted also that much of the needed legislation of the country today considered by Congress originates from the executive branch. Each year after the President of the Philippines outlines his legislative program in his State-of-the-Nation Address, executive departments and agencies transmit to the House and the Senate drafts of proposed legislations to carry out the President’s program..</p>
